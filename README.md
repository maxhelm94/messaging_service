# messaging_service
A simple messaging service that locally simulates its functionality

The code uploaded is my part of a larger project coded with fellow students. This was a first year university project. As I only uploaded my part of the
code base, it is not functional without the other parts. The code just serves as demonstration of my skills for future employers.
